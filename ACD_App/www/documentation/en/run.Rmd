# Running the ACD-App

To run the application, just double click on the file `ACD-App.bat`. After a few seconds, a web browser opens. The ACD-App interface appears directly on the web-browser (see Figure 9). The application is ready to use!

It can also be accessed from other computers connected to the Intranet. To access to the ACD-App from another PC, open a browser (e.g. Mozilla) and type the following Address:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- system("ipconfig", intern=TRUE)
z <- x[grep("IPv4", x)]
ip <- gsub(".*? ([[:digit:]])", "\\1", z)

cat(paste0("http://",ip, ":3182"))
```

The user has to select then on of the following source of data:

* CLIMSOFT
* DWD-ftp
* LOCAL_FILE

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(fig.path, "data_source.png"))
```
